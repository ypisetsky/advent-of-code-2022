# AdventOfCode

This is the set of my solutions to Advent of Code 2022, in Elixir. It requires a working elixir setup, which
you can get with, say `apt install elixir` on Ubuntu.

To run them, configure `:path_prefix` in `config/config.exs` to point to where this is checked out, then run
`iex -S mix`. This will get you an Elixir prompt. You can do things like `Day1.solve1()`, `Day3.solve2()`, etc.

For days where I bothered to save a small input `Day1.solve2("small")` will run against that.
